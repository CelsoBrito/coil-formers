> Pattern Classifier Based on Image Processing: Application in Wire Coil Formers

ðŸš€ This is a part of the code of a scientific research, of my university about:

- Computer vision;
- Image processing;
- Singular value decomposition;
- Ensemble empirical mode decomposition;
- Extreme learning machine;
- Classifiers standards;
- Control;
- Automation;
- Instrumentation;
- Industry 4.0;

This work is expected to gain efficiency in the process of forming coils
steel mills, contributing to the theory-practice transition and the partnership of company and
university.
